# The Fabricant Launches Wholeland The Ultimate Web3 Fashion Experience
Pioneering startup The Fabricant has gone live with its boundary-pushing digital fashion storytelling project Wholeland, with a trailer that sets the scene for a provocative world that splices digital couture, mythology and the rave scene.

The ambitious move is designed to raise the bar for the wider digital fashion industry, and lead a shift in focus away from the bear market to building Web3 experiences that create long-term, high-value engagement.

The OG digital fashion player is famous for its world-leading craftsmanship, gaining global prominence when it was founded as the world’s first digital fashion house in 2018. It sold the first-ever digital garment on blockchain for 54 ETH in 2019 ($9,500 at the time). Notable collabs with physical brands such as Off-White, Adidas and World of Women contributed to it raising $14M in Series A funding in April this year.
Wholeland is described as a digital fashion story and a visually rich journey of self-discovery that unfolds across 7 chapters. Each chapter includes digital couture, AR wearables, co-creation, fashion shows, metaverse meet-ups and airdrops.
‌
Access to Wholeland can only be gained through minting one of The Fabricant’s pieces of AR facewear, called XXories, that act as a key to the wider experience.
