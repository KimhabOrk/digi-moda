# Biggest Fashion Brands Are Preparing For a Crypto Revolution

The pace of the luxury industry is rapidly accelerating due to a tremendous increase in consumer demand— that has been ever changing. Even though the general consumer market seems to be more complex than ever before, it pales in comparison when compared to the complexity of luxury goods market. The reason being is two-fold. Firstly, when it comes to personal tastes, the luxury market segmentation can be hard to please. Furthermore, when it comes to staying on top of the latest trends— with respect to pop-culture and technology, the luxury market is willing to listen and learn.

In the recent past, luxury brands have embraced virtual experiences, infusing technology into their product design and even collaborations with tech-brands for more crossover appeal. Just last week, I met with the USDA and the American Cotton Farmers to discuss the future of maintaining the comparative advantage of one of the finest cottons on the global market today; Supima cotton. I was shocking surprised to learn how the American luxury cotton brand had adopted the use of virtual reality as an integral part of their marketing strategy. There’s no denying it, technology and luxury fashion have united and will continue to move forward together.

Take AURA for example; it is a consortium blockchain pioneered by the LVMH Group to track and trace luxury goods— from raw materials to the point of sale — in order to assure consumers of product history and proof of authenticity. Now, the question remains whether or not forthright luxury brands will move forward with crypto-currency. And rightly so. In the last decade alone, cryptocurrency has become one of the most disruptive technologies on the planet— securing global acceptance in abundant numbers. In fact, these days, companies such as Time Warner and WeWork are accepting bitcoin as a trusted payment standard. But the question is; will luxury brands be next to lean-in to a crypto future?
